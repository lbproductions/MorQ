MorQ 0.0
========

MorQ is a Qt based Media Organizer for TV Shows and Downloads.

It is currently WIP and not meant for release.

Setup
=====

MorQ uses several levels of gut submodules. You will need to initialize these modules by running the following command:
````
git submodule update --init --recursive
````

Tower.app does currently not support recursive submodules. So you will have to run this command, even if you checked "Initialize submodules" when cloning this repository.

License
=======

MorQ is licensed under the LGPLv3.0. See LICENSE for details.
